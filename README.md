# ableton-cli
A CLI application to interface with Ableton Live.

This is a clojurescript project targeting NodeJS, using
[blessed](https://github.com/chjj/blessed) along with [max4node](https://github.com/alpacaaa/max4node).
The end goal is to have a CLI app to be able to manipulate scenes,
edit audio and MIDI tracks, change parameters on devices, as well as
a basic step sequencer/piano roll for MIDI tracks.
